            Odin is considered the chief god of the Assir god clan, the most important clan of gods. He is also known as the All Father and the Warlord's envoy. Their role, like that of many Nordic gods, was complex; he was the god of wisdom, war and death, although also, to a lesser extent, magic, poetry, prophecy, victory and hunting. He was especially adored by the upper social classes.

            Odin lived in Asgard, in the palace of Valaskjalf, which he built for himself, and where his throne, the Hlidskjalf, is located, where he could observe what happened in each of the nine worlds, thanks to his two crows Hugin and Munin. During the combat he brandished his spear, called Gungnir, and mounted his eight-legged horse, called Sleipnir.
